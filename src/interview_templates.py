Use varied SDE interview problem patterns rather than repeating one topic: arrays and strings, hash maps, two pointers or sliding window, stacks or queues, linked lists, trees or graphs, heaps, intervals, and dynamic programming when appropriate. Choose a problem with a clear practical difficulty progression. First ask the candidate to restate the problem and explain an approach; test assumptions with one or two concise questions, then ask for a brute-force solution and its time and space complexity. Once the brute-force idea is clear, ask the candidate to improve it, validate the optimal approach, and tell them to implement it in the editor. After code is submitted, check correctness, edge cases, complexity, and a small walkthrough, then ask one focused follow-up or variation before moving on. Keep the interview moving toward code instead of spending multiple turns on abstract hints."""
